# Simple Shell - `sh`

Welcome to our custom implementation of the Bourne Shell (`sh`). This project is a collaborative effort to create a minimal yet functional shell environment.

## Features
- Custom command-line interpreter based on the Bourne Shell (`sh`).
- Handles basic command execution, changing directories, and more.

## Getting Started

### Compilation
To compile the shell, use the following command:
```bash
$ gcc -Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra -std=gnu89 *.c
```
### Usage
Once compiled, you can start the shell by running
```bash
./a.out
```
### Example commands
Here are a few basic commands you can try with our custom shell:
- `ls` - List directory contents (Accepts arguments like `-l`, `-a` too).
- `cd` - Change the current directory.
- `echo` - Display a line of text.
- `exit` - Exit the exit. (`Ctrl + C` works as well.)
### Project Details
- Language: C
- Standard: Gnu89
- Warnings: All enabled for best practices and error prevention.
